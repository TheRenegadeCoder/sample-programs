## Testing
This language currently does not feature testing. If you'd like to help in the efforts to test all
of the code in this repo, consider creating a testinfo.yml file with the following information:
        
```yml
folder:
  extension: 
  naming:

container:
  image: 
  tag: 
  cmd:
```

See the [Glotter project](https://github.com/auroq/glotter) for more information on how to create a testinfo file.
