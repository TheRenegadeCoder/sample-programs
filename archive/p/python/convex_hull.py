    a x b = | i    j    k |

    a x b = k|a1   a2|
             |b1   b2|

    Also a x b is positive only when they are clockwise, relative to coord axes; i.e. b is future path of a.

    Thus vector product holds the key for rotation.

    | x2-x1  x3-x1 |
    | y2-y1  y3-y1 |
    So, we shift the origin on x1, y1 and then we compute this determinant for sign takings.

    Thus this determinant's sign will tell about the sign of normal vector.
    Also, in cross product, when angle is 0, sintheta is 0 thus result is zero.
