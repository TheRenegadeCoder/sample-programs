## Fun Facts

- Debut: 2010
- Developer: Rust Project Developers
- Typing: Static
- Rust Compiler cautions Developers about Unused Variables
- Rust nearly has no Null Pointer Exceptions(NPE), which is it's key bragging point.
- 70% of Code Vulnerabilities and Errors(CVE's) in Windows Operating System are due to memory Safety, which is Prime advantage of using Rust.
