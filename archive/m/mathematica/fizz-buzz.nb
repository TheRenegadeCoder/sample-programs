(* Code *)

(* It would be easy to simply print these out in a loop; however, in the spirit
of keeping the mathematical operation separate from its presentation I opted
to return the result as a list explicitly: *)

fizzBuzz = Function[{n},
   Table[
    Which[
     Divisible[i, 15], "FizzBuzz",
     Divisible[i, 5], "Buzz",
     Divisible[i, 3], "Fizz",
     True, i], {i, n}]];

(* This can be presented trivially: *)

Column[fizzBuzz[100]]
