(* Code *)

(* The Mathematica built-in Factorial essentially provides the required behavior;
so the only code needed is the 'user interface' to make it look a little more
like a Unix command-line tool: *)

factorialMain = Catch[
    (* convert string to integer, or throw *)
    If[
     StringMatchQ[#, DigitCharacter ..],
     FromDigits[#]!,
     Throw["Usage: please input a non-negative integer"]]] &;


(* Valid Tests *)

Print /@ factorialMain /@ {"0", "1", "4", "8", "10"};

(* Note that Mathematica (as far as I know) doesn't impose an upper limit on computations: *)
factorialMain["10000"]


(* Invalid Tests *)

factorialMain[""]
factorialMain["asdf"]
factorialMain["-1"]
