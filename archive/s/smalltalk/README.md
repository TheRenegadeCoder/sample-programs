# Sample Programs in Smalltalk

Welcome to Sample Programs in Smalltalk! To find documentation related to the Smalltalk code in this repo, look [here.](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/smalltalk)

## Sample Programs List - 1/40 :disappointed:

In this section, we feature a list of completed and missing programs in Smalltalk. See above for the current amount of completed programs in Smalltalk. If you see a program that is missing and would like to add it, please submit an issue, so we can assign it to you.

### Completed Programs

Below, you'll find a list of completed code snippets in Smalltalk. Code snippets preceded by :warning: link to a GitHub issue query featuring a possible article request issue. If an article request issue doesn't exist, we encourage you to create one. Meanwhile, code snippets preceded by :white_check_mark: link to an existing article which provides further documentation. To see the list of approved projects, check out the official Sample Programs projects list.
