## Testing

This language currently does not feature testing. If you'd like to help in the efforts to test all of the code in this repo, consider creating a testinfo.yml file with the following information:

```yml
folder:
  extension:
  naming:

container:
  image:
  tag:
  cmd:
```

See the [Glotter project](https://github.com/auroq/glotter) for more information on how to create a testinfo file.
