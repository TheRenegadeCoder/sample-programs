Welcome to the [Sample Programs in Every Language][0] repository! What began
as a simple [100 Days of Code][1] challenge has expanded into a fun project.
Within this repository, you'll find a growing collection of simple programs
in just about every programming language to date.

## Learn More

Originally, I had planned to have an article written for every code snippet in this repository.
However, in the interest of growing this collection, I removed the pull request merge article requirement.
As a result, not every code snippet in the repository has an associated article, yet.

Of course, we're adding articles every day, and we're tracking our article progress under the issues tab.
Feel free to request your favorites from there, and we'll try to move them up the queue. If you can't wait,
consider writing the article yourself. Prospective authors can find directions in the [contributing doc][6].

At any rate, if articles sound interesting, here are a few to get you started:

- [Sample Programs in Every Language][0]
- [Hello World in Every Language][2]
- [Reverse a String in Every Language][3]
- [The Coolest Programming Language Features][4]
- [Longest Palindromic Substring in Every Language][16]
- [Fizz Buzz in Every Language][18]

Alternatively, feel free to leverage the links in the README files spread throughout the repository.
In addition, we have a rather extensive [wiki][5] which includes a table row for every language
in the repository. For each language, you'll find information like open issues and the number of snippets.

Finally, you can keep up with the latest happening in this repository as well as all the others in this
organization through our Gitter community. [Come chat!][15]
