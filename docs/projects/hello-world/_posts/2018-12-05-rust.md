In this article, we'll demonstrate how to implement Hello World in Rust.

## How to Implement the Solution
Hello World in Rust is very similar to [Hello World in C][1]:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

In fact, Rust’s implementation is even easier. There’s no need to import 
any IO packages to get access to _println_. We just need to create our main 
function, add our print code, and we’re done.

But, wait a minute. That __print line__ seems a little off. What’s with the bang `!`? 
To be honest, I had to do a bit of digging for this. As it turns out, _println_ is 
not a function at all. __It’s a built-in macro__. That’s a new term for me, so let’s 
learn a little more about it.

According to [the Rust Programming Language book][2], macros are a language feature 
that allow you to abstract syntax. In other words, macros allow you to do some 
metaprogramming by adding grammar to Rust’s abstract syntax tree. Perhaps an example 
would make more sense:

```rust
macro_rules! println {
    () => (print!("\n"));
    ($fmt:expr) => (print!(concat!($fmt, "\n")));
    ($fmt:expr, $($arg:tt)*) => (print!(concat!($fmt, "\n"), $($arg)*));
}
```

This is the actual [definition of the _println_ macro in Rust][3]. I won’t go into 
exactly what’s happening, but basically we have defined three available patterns 
for _println_: empty, one argument, and variable arguments. Rust functions don’t 
have support for variable arguments, so you can add the functionality with macros.

That said, I’m only just learning macros for the first time, so I recommend an 
article by Kasper Anderson called [why Rust has macros][4]. It’s quite thorough, 
and I think it does a better job than Rust’s documentation.

## How to Run the Solution

As always, we can try out this code using an [online Rust compiler][5]. All we 
need to do is drop the code into the editor and hit run.

Alternatively, we can [download the latest Rust compiler][6] and a [copy of the solution][7]. 
Then, assuming the compiler is in the path, navigate to folder with the solution and run 
the following in Windows:

```console
rustc hello-world.rs
hello-world.exe
```

Of course, in Unix-based environments, the following will run the new binary:

```console
./hello-world
```

And, that’s it! “Hello, World!” should print directly to the console.
