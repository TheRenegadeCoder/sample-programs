In this article, we'll demonstrate how to implement Hello World in C.

## How to Implement the Solution

Since C predates both Java and Python, the syntax is naturally a bit archaic. 
That said, you’ll find that the syntax for Hello World in C is still easier to 
understand than Java:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

At the top, we’ll notice an _include_ statement. Basically, this statement copies 
in functionality from the standard IO library of C. This includes the _printf_ 
functionality we’ll need to actually write our string to the command line.

Like Java, we’ll notice that we have a main function. In C, the main function is 
much simpler. In fact, we don’t even have classes in C, so we don’t have to bother 
with that extra layer of abstraction. Instead, we can define the main function 
directly. Again, we can only define one of these per program.

Inside the main function, we’ll find our usual call to print. However, in C, 
we use _printf_ which allows us to format strings as well.

Finally, we’ll notice that we return zero. That’s because the main function is 
like any other function, so it has a return type. In this case, the return type 
is an integer, and that integer is used to indicate status codes. A status code 
of zero means no errors occurred.

## How to Run the Solution

Now, if we want to run the solution, we’ll need to [get a hold of a C compiler][1]. 
In addition, we’ll probably want to [get a copy of Hello World in C][2]. With both 
prerequisites out of the way, all we have to do is navigate to our file and run 
the following commands from the command line:

```
gcc -o hello-world hello-world.c
./hello-world
```

Of course, these are Unix/Linux instructions. If we’re on Windows, it may be easier 
to take advantage of an [online C compiler][3]. Alternatively, we can leverage a tool 
like [MinGW][4].
