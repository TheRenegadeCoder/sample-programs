In this article, we'll implement Hello World in Hack.

## How to Implement the Solution

At long last, let’s take a stab at Hello World in Hack:

```hack
<?hh
echo 'Hello, World!';
```

Right away, you should scream “that looks a lot like PHP!” 
After all, Hack is just a dialect of PHP.

That said, there is at least one obvious syntactic difference: 
the Hack tag. I can’t seem to figure out the formal name of 
the <?hh tag, so I’ve been calling it the Hack tag. At any 
rate, at least that’s different.

Beyond the tag, Hello World in Hack is exactly the same in Hello 
World in PHP. However, I will point out that you can’t mix HTML 
with Hack like you can with PHP, so that’s probably the biggest 
syntactic difference. Otherwise, both languages perform a similar 
function: backend web development.[^grifski_hwhack_2018]

## How to Run the Solution

If we want to try this code, we can use an online Hack compiler. 

Alternatively, we can download the Hack Virtual Machine to run 
Hack code locally. From there, I recommend reading up on how to 
get started with Hack. Getting everything up and running is bit 
out of scope of this article.[^grifski_hwhack_2018]
