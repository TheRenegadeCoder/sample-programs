In this article, we will writing a program to calculate the factorial of a number in Python.


## How to Implement the Solution

Let's look at the code in detail:

code for [factorial.py](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/master/archive/p/python/factorial.py):-

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys


def factorial(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial (n - 1)


def exit_with_error(msg=None):
    msg = msg or 'Usage: please input a non-negative integer'
    print(msg)
    sys.exit(1)


def main(args):
    try:
        n = int(args[0])
        if n < 0:
            exit_with_error()
        elif n >= 996:
            exit_with_error('{}! is out of the reasonable bounds for calculation'.format(n))
        print(factorial(n))
    except (IndexError, ValueError):
        exit_with_error()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv[1:])
```

  

### The Main Function

Let us breakdown the code in smaller parts,

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv[1:])
```
This bit of code checks to see if this is the main module run. If true then it calls the main function and passes user input to it. In this case the user input would be a number like `0 or 1 or 50 or n(0<=n<996)`.

```python
def main(args):
    try:
        n = int(args[0])
        if n < 0:
            exit_with_error()
        elif n >= 996:
            exit_with_error('{}! is out of the reasonable bounds for calculation'.format(n))
        print(factorial(n))
    except (IndexError, ValueError):
        exit_with_error()
```

This is the main function of this file. It parses the input into an integer, then calls our factorial function (and prints the results). It also deals with any errors which arise when the input `n is such that it violates the property: (0<=n<996), i.e. n is greater than equal to 0 and less than 996`.

 
### Throw Errors

```python
def exit_with_error(msg=None):
    msg = msg or 'Usage: please input a non-negative integer'
    print(msg)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This function prints a message if given (else default) and then exits the script with an error, `sys.exit(1)`. If any non-zero value is returned then the program didn't complete properly. This function is called if the user input is either less than zero or greater than equal to 996.

### Factorial

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial (n - 1)
```

Finally, the real deal. This function takes a positive integer (less than 996) and returns the factorial of that number. This function `factorial` is a recursive function that calls itself repeatedly while decreasing the input parameter by one on each subsequent call, until the base case is reached 
(n <= 0).

Once the base case is reached the call-stack unfolds itself propagating the results to the subsequent calling function, which in this case will be the same function itself.

For example, if `3` is the input:

* First we compare, if 3 <= 0
* False
* return 3 * factorial(3-1)
* Call `factorial(2)`

Now, for `2` as the input:  

* First we compare, if 2 <= 0
* False
* return 2 * factorial(2-1) 
> meanwhile the original call would look like: 
> return 3 * 2 * factorial(2-1)
* Call `factorial(1)`

Now, for `1` as the input:
* First we compare, if 1 <= 0
* False
* return 1 * factorial(1-1) 
> meanwhile the original call would look like:
> return 3 * 2 * 1 * factorial(1-1)
* Call `factorial(0)`

Now, for `0` as the input:
* First we compare, if 0 <= 0
* True
* return 1

Since we reached the base case, now we calculate the the values while moving up towards the original function call.

    factorial(0) = 1  (base-case)
    
    factorial(1) = 1 * factorial(1-1) = 1 * factorial(0) = 1 * 1 = 1
    
    factorial(2) = 2 * factorial(2-1) = 2 * factorial(1) = 2 * 1 = 2
    
    factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(3-1) = 3 * factorial(2) = 3 * 2 = 6

  

## How to Run Solution

If you want to run this program, you can download a copy of [Factorial in Python](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/master/archive/p/python/factorial.py).

Next, make sure you have the latest Python interpreter (latest stable version of Python 3 will do).

Finally, open a terminal in the directory of the downloaded file and run the following command:  

`python factorial.py 3`

Alternatively, copy the solution into an online [Python interpreter](https://colab.research.google.com) and hit run.
