With sixteen of these tutorials already out of the way, it will probably 
come as no surprise that I took to Wikipedia to learn more about Haskell.

As stated already, Haskell is a general-purpose functional programming 
language that first appeared in 1990. Despite its relatively old age, 
Haskell is still maintained. In fact, the latest standard was developed 
back in 2010. By 2020, a new update should be available.

In terms of features, Haskell supports strong, static typing, pattern 
matching, lazy evaluation, and even list comprehensions. To be honest, 
this is the first time I’m hearing about lazy evaluation, so I figured 
I’d dig into that a bit.

As it turns out, lazy evaluation is a technique which defers computation 
of a functions input until the value is needed. In other words, expressions 
are only evaluated when they are needed. If my explanation is bad, take a 
look at the article I linked above. It covers the concept in great depth.

At any rate, I think that’s plenty of background for now[^grifski_hwhaskell_2018].
