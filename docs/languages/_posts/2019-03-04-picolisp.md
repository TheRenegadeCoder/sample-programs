According to Wikipedia, PicoLisp is a dialect of Lisp which was first developed in 1988 by Alexander Burger. Since then, PicoLisp has seen some variation including the latest Java version known as Ersatz PicoLisp.

In terms of features, PicoLisp is dynamically typed and simple/minimalist—sorry, info on the language is quite limited. For simplicity, PicoLisp only supports one internal data type, the cell. Beyond that, PicoLisp supports linked lists which means the language is an excellent list processor.

Today, PicoLisp can be found on GitHub as an open-source project. For more information, check out the PicoLisp Official Website.
