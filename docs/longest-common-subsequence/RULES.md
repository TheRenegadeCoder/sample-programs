# Longest Common Subsequence

Given two arrays of numbers, find the longest common subsequence. For example, let's say we have the
following pair of arrays:

```
A = [1, 4, 5, 3, 15, 6]
B = [1, 7, 4, 5, 11, 6]
```

The longest common subsequence is `1, 4, 5, 6`.

Write a program which accepts two command line arguments--each list--and outputs the longest
common subsequence between the two lists. Input arguments should be in comma separated list notation:
`1, 2, 14, 11, 31, 7, 9`.

Your program should be able to parse these lists into some internal representation in your
choice language (ideally an array). From there, the program should compare the two arrays
to find the longest common subsequence and output it in comma separated list notation to the user.

The following is recursive pseudocode that you can use for reference:

```
LCS(arrayA, arrayB, indexA, indexB):
  if indexA == 0 || indexB == 0:
    return 0
  else if arrayA[indexA - 1] == arrayB[indexB - 1]:
    return 1 + LCS(arrayA, arrayB, indexA - 1, indexB - 1)
  else:
    return max(LCS(arrayA, arrayB, indexA - 1, indexB), LCS(arrayA, arrayB, indexA, indexB - 1))
```

Unfortunately, this pseudocode only gives us the length of the longest common subsequence. Since we
want to actually *print* the result, we'll probably need to augment this algorithm a bit. Also,
it may be useful to implement the memoized solution for the sake of efficiency.
